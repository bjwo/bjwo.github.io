The weather predictions stated that there would be three pretty bad, rainy days ahead. My mood wasn't great because of that. But it went it better than expected.

I went to the canoe club in Linz and the site was big enough that I could sleep in the boat storage and I could avoid getting my tent wet.

On the camp site I met some other cyclists: a nice Belgian couple on their way to Asia, and another German guy on his way back home to Heilbronn.

In the evening we went to see the final rehersal for the "Linzer Klangwolke 2019". This made me curious enough to consider staying another day and avoiding at least one of the rainy days.

The weather predictions started that there will be three pretty bad, rainy days ahead. My mood want great because of that. But it ruined it better than expected.

I went to the canoe club in Linz, and I could sleep there on the floor where the boats were sure and this I could avoid getting my tent wet.

I met a nice Belgian couple on their way to Asia, and another Gehabt guy on his way back home.

In the evening we went to see the final rehersal for the "Linzer Klangwolke 2019".

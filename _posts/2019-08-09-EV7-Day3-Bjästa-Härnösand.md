Today we hit the road early with perfect cycling weather conditions. Even though the road was a constant uphill and downhill again we just absolutely love the scenery! Every climb to a hilltol was rewarded with yet another stunning view.

The most breathtaking moment was definitely the ride over the höga kusten bron (high coast bridge) - in every sense... First, it offers an amazing view over the high coast and the bay. Secondly, the road was closed to cyclists due to construction on the suspension structure. However, we did not see the sign as we had entered the road behind it and there was no alternativ route either. Of course, we were stopped by a construction worker who, on the one hand, told us that we could not cycle over the bridge but, on the other hand, could not give us an alternative route either. And since he "would not stop us physically" (quote) from continuing the ride over the bridge and we did not know how else to cross over the bay to Härnösand (except a 50 km detour over a mountain), we just continued. After all, that way we had the entire lane to ourselves...

There was one other longer stretch along the E4 where there was no shoulder at all for cyclists, forcing us to cycle on the right lane again. However, the good news is: the cycle road next to it is already under construction and will probably be finished in a couple of weeks.

Tonight we are staying at a beautiful white sand beach on the peninsula near Härnösand. There is a shelter directly on the beach, and even a WC with water here. Plus: a fireplace with wood.
Great place!

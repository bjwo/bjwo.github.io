Dani - my girlfriend - was supposed to arrive around noon in Helsinki. Unfortunately, she was re-booked to a direct flight from Stuttgart to Helsinki, to a flight via Munich. Even more unfortunately, there was some security incident in Munich that morning and some lady had entered the gated area of the airport, without going through the security checks. This ensued in a complete chaos in Muich and it wasn't clear if Dani could fly at all on that date to Helsinki or not.

Later it turned out that Dani could fly, but her bicycle did not come with her - and it was unclear where the bike was left off (Stuttgart? Munich?). So lots of chaos and uncertainty, especially as we already had booked out train to travel to Vaasa to see my family.

In the end it all turned out well. :) I was able to do some sightseeing in Helsinki with Dani and on the morning before we had to catch the train we were able to collect her bike from the airport.

I spent the day, doing some sightseeing, route planning, I'm trying to find some gas cartridge for my cooker, which proved to be a quiet difficult task.

I don't even like to cook that much, as it takes up too much time, but I heard stories that they were long stretches on the upcoming route, without any kind of civilization, restaurants or even shops. So for these situations I would like to have a cookout with me to be able to borrow some water, and maybe some spaghetti if there's no other possibility to get some food.

My best friends decided to take another route from here on, so in the evening we had to say farewell.

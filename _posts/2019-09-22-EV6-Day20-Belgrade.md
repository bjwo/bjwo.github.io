I spent the day doing some sightseeing around town, route planning and trying to find a gas cartridge for my cooker - which I didn't succeed in.

I don't like to cook that much on this trip, as it takes up too much time. However, I heard stories that there are rather long long stretches on the upcoming route, without any kind of civilization, restaurants or even shops. So for these emergency situations I would like to have a stove with me to be able to boil some water and cook some spaghetti if there's no other possibility to get some food.

My Dutch friends decided to take another route from here on (towards Sofia), so in the evening we had to say farewell. ðŸ˜­

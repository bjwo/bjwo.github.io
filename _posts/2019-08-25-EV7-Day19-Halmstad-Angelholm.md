Today we saw our third elk - this time from a distance of only 3-4 meters! He was really nice and didn't mind us.

Before lunch in Båstad we were surprised by the steepest incline of our trip. And we were now in the sun at 29°C. When we got to the posh golf club, my shirt was drenched, but fortunately we were allowed to have a shower there before eating a very good - though pricey - lunch.

We made it a bit past the town of Ängelholm. The Skåneleden also passes through here, so there are a couple of designated wild camp sites for wanderers. The one we had picked out for the night even featured running water, coal and USB outlets. Besides us there were already three other parties also staying for the night. But the site was huge so that wasn't any issue at all.

We had our dinner at a bird watching platform in the nearby nature reserve and saw once again a beautiful sunset.

Fortunately, this night the loud geese were a bit further away.

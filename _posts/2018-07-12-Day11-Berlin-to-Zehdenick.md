_#day11: had a late start around noon due to rain in Berlin in the morning. There were some smaller rain showers throughout the day, but all in all I got lucky and stayed mostly dry.
<br><br>
I was now following the cycle route Berlin - Copenhagen, and this route prooved to be quite popular. For the first time on my trip, I saw lots of fellow bikepackers, even though the weather was a bit grim.
<br><br>
Also I met @brinibellini (heading to CPH) and we shared the road for a while and chatted. It's fun to meet people with a similar mindset. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>
We split ways in Oranienburg as I wanted to do some more kilometers.
<br><br>
The shelters I found on the way didn't quite suite me, but I then found a little camp site at a lake which wasn't on any of my maps. Officially, it's shut down, but I met a cool older guy - Frank - (a friend of the owner) who let me into the camp site anyway (yay, shower!) and we had a nice long talk until midnight.

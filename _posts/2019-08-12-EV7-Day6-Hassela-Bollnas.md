The day started with a little rain, but after two hours on the road in the rain it cleared up and we had a really nice day with even some sunshine. Generally it seems to be quite hard to predict the weather here, as all weather apps are quite unreliable.

Also there were some bigger hills to climb - so we conquered 1200 hm over a stretch of 122 km. But as we were well rested, we weren't quite as tired as the evenings before.

The region here is so beautiful, but I'll let the pictures talk for themselves.

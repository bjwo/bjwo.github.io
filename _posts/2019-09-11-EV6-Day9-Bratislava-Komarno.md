Today I woke up and felt a little weak and sick with some coughing. So I decided to take it slowly.

I cycled out of Bratislava, and for the first 60 km the cycle path was amazing - paved and very straight along a dam.

Along the way I met Christian from Austria, who also just started his cycling to to the Black Sea - and we kept chatting for a couple of hours and had lunch together.

After lunch I continued on my own, and that's when the road conditions got a lot worse - gravel roads with sandy stretches on between.

So I only made it to Kom√°rno, still in Slovakia, but right across the bridge from the Hungarian border. There is a camp site right across a thermal bath. When I made it there, I was very exhausted, even though the tour wasn't even that long. Still feeling a little sick. ü§í

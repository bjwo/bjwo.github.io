_Today we cycled the remaining 108 km from Simrishamn to Trelleborg along Sweden's South coast.
<br><br>
We woke up to a herd of cows chilling and eating next to our shelter.
<br>
Then the conditions were in our favor - hardly any headwind. Yay.
<br>
Once we arrived we meet a lovely couple bikepacking on a tandem with a trailer and their 5 month old son. They had also suffered on the same roads in northern Poland, so we had some stories to share. Really nice and inspiring people.
<br>
Tomorrow night we'll take the ferry to Rostock and then the train back home to Mannheim._

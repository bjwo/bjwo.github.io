Today was supposed to be a beautiful day for cycling. We had decided to cycle between lake Vänern and lake Vättern and to contribute along the EV7.

However, pretty soon some dark clouds with heavy rain and thunder came in our way. So we quickly clerked the map, retraced the latest 3 km and choose to ride along Sverigeleden instead. 

Again, very beautiful swedish landscapes and wooden houses in the characteristic Falun red. We especially liked the little town of Söderbärke.

We had picked a shelter at a lake a bit south of the town. When we got there, we found an information board detailing further shelters and even some shelter houses (Raststuga).

We couldn't initially locate them, but after asking some locals they pointed us in the right direction to an old Smith's house on a hill near a picturesque little stream called _Lumsån_. The shelter is mainly used by flyfishers. The silence at night is very eerie, when you're used to constant city noise.

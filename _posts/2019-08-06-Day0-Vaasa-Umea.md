Today we are taking the ferry from Vaasa in Finland to UmeÃ¥ in Sweden. We spent a week with my family in Finland and in the Kvarken Archipelago.

Trying to accommodate for rainy days and cold nights in Sweden while trying to pack light is not so easy and you are constantly worried that you forgot something vital. But now we're on the ship and feel ready and psyched for our coming bicycling adventure along the EuroVelo 7. ðŸ˜Š

On my bike trip last year I met another bike traveller on the way out from Berlin. She also is on a bike trip along the EV10 this year and by fortune she arrived in Vaasa today. It was fun to meet again and she came to bid us farewell at the ferry.

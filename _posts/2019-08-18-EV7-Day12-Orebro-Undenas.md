We rode a little bit on the Eurovelo 7 today, but as we want to go to GÃ¶teborg - and the EV7  doesn't pass through there - we will now leave the route completely.

In the evening we found a nice shelter directly on the shore of lake Viken. There was already a nice Dutch guy with his Adventure truck on the site, but he didn't sleep in the shelter and so we were fine and good to stay there.

There were some heave reason showers in the night, but fortunately this shelter didn't leak. ðŸ˜Š

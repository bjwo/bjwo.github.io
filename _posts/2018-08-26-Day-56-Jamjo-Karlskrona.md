_We took a day off from cycling, booked us a hotel in Karlskrona and enjoyed the beautiful weather and city. 🏡🇸🇪 And we had again had two coincidental meet-ups: We met Doro again in the morning on the side of the road, and in Karlskrona friends of my parents recognized us and yelled my name. Small world, indeed. 😁_

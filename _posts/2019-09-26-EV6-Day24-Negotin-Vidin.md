I only cycled a short distance today. I crossed the border to Bulgaria and made it to Vidin.

There I was researching to find a place to stay for the so I would know how far I should go. But I didn't find any nice places for a reasonable price, so I decided to call it a day and to relax a bit. After all I am before schedule and would get to Bucharest way ahead of my schedule.

I met these really nice older guys at the fortress in Vidin. They were so excited to see me and wanted to know everything about my bike and my trip.

But generally, I had the impression that the people were not do friendly in Bulgaria. Most people didn't smile or wave back as I cycled by.

In the evening I went to the cinema to see the new Brad Pitt movie. It was ok. ðŸ˜‰

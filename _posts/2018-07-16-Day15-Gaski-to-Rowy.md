_#day15: Not much to share, even though I wasn't lazy. Did 121 km yesterday, as I wanted to get closer to Gdansk and to make use of the time while it was not raining. Unfortunately, in a lot of places the roads just aren't there yet. So it was a tough fight. Found a relatively nice camp site which wasn't too crowded.<br> #ev10 #eurovelo10 #121km #bikepacking #cycle2finland_

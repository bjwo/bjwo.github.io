_#day7: Made it to Berlin today. In the morning it was really cold and for the first time I had to bring out my warmer clothing layers. Also, while I was in the Wittenberg district the bike roads were pretty bad. This all changed as I got closer to Potsdam. Had a shower at a public swimming pool, then the sun came out, the roads got great and the landscape a lot more interesting. As it was a Sunday, *everybody* made use of the good weather and went to the beautiful surrounding area of Potsdam with their boats and bicycles. So many people! Felt a bit strange after having seen so very few people in the days before. I never knew how beautiful the area is, as I had only been to Berlin city before.

Fortunately I get to stay in the beautiful flat of Daniel and Anne, who are currently on a cycling trip themselves. Thank you so much! üòä
<br><br>
In the evening I went for a little ride without my luggage to grab dinner food. Man, it is insane without all that weight! Judging by the acceleration this is what it must feel like to ride an e-bike. üòÅ So my legs have definitely become stronger during this past week.
<br><br>
I will now have 3 rest days in Berlin, as there is some heavy rain expected on Wednesday.

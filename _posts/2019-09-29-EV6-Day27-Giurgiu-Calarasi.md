I continued racing through the landscape and was on good time very well, until I decided to have lunch at a restaurant.
After a little while the owner started chatting with me, and we talked for come to three hours probably. It was great and I learned again lots about Romania, however when you try to make it to your accommodation in daylight you always feel rushed. ☺️

Again, there was no cheap room to be found, so ultimately I booked a room for ~25€ at a hotel. And it turned out to be huge. I would have preferred smaller, more simple and cheaper, though. 😉

Oh, and of course I didn't make it in the daylight.

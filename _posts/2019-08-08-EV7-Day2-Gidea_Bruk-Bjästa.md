We woke up only to find that it was raining rather heavily. We first tried to wait it out for a little while, but the weather prognosis did not look promising.
However, after the first hour on the road the rain stopped and there were only a few short showers after that.

Additionally, we have now officially reached the [H√∂ga Kusten]() - the high coast. For us, this means a constant uphill-downhill rollercoaster-like route...  However, the landscape is just beautiful. 

We were already quite exhausted and hungry when we reached √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik for lunch - in the local ice hockey stadium where we could observe the training while eating. A big lunch - including a salad buffet, salmon fillets, drinks (coffee, water, milk, light beer) only costs ~9‚Ç¨. This is why we typically make it a priority to stop at some decent lunch place.

Because the weather had changed for the better (contrary to what the prognosis said), we decided to continue cycling.
Shortly after the small town of Bj√§sta (where we bought dinner at a supermarket and filled up all water bottles) we encountered an old lady that Bj√∂rn asked about shelters nearby.
She recommended a shelter/house as well as a public bath at a lake where we could take a shower. We had to climb a few hills before we found the place. And what kind of a place! Next to a small beach there was a sauna and a hot (!!!) shower as well as a few picnic tables. After a strenuous day like today it felt like heaven.
I even went for a little swim in the lake. Infoeinbau wer dient habe enough time to heat up the sauna. üòÑ

We did not expect the last 4 km to the shelter to be so hard as we had to cycle on a sandy gravel road going mostly uphill with all water bottles filled. 
We were rewarded twice: first we got to see a wild moose ü¶å running through the woods - who seemed even more surprised than us. Second we found the shelter to be a proper house with an oven and fire wood (Skrikestuga, Bj√§sta).

Therefore, a day, that had started out very wet and little promising actually turned out to be pretty awesome and we still made 92 km with more than 1000 hm.

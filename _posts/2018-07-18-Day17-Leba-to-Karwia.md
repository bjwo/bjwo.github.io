_#day17: was again a tough day and I only managed to get #63km done. However, due to my adjusted, lowered expectations, I am proud to say that I did not yell any profanities once. üòâ
<br><br>
In the morning it was still raining she heavily, so I could only get started at 1 pm. There were only two possible bike routes, and as I had heard terrible things about the one south of Sarbsko lake (apparently current R10), I chose the bike road between the sea and the lake (apparently old R10?). It started out ok, bit then things got bad again - you can see it in the picture. On top, there were hoardes of mosquitos attacking me today. <br>
So again, for the 10 km it took me two hours and a lot of strength. Then I had to clean up my bike and oil the chain at a river in the next village. For today, I was fed up with polish dirt roads, the #r10 and #ev10. <br>
I also learned that the signs and the route from internet for the official bike road #r10 often diverges. So you are constantly wondering and doubting if you are in the right track, or if the other one would have been an better option. This doubt adds a lot to my frustration, I guess.
<br><br>
And the nature is so very beautiful here, but I didn't get time to properly admire it, as I had to concentrate on the road and to not get devoured by mosquitos.
<br><br>
So I decided to stick to the national highways for cars, and due the first time in two days I could actually ride again - it felt so nice. üòä It took a little time for all the sand to get out of the gears and chain, and for the bike to shift again properly, but now it all sounds good again.
<br><br>
I made my way to a simple and small camp site right behind the dunes in Karwia. So I had my dinner am the beach and that makes up for a lot of the trouble.

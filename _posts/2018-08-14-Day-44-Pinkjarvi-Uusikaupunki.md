_Yesterday the weather got better again and we cycled 97km from PinkjÃ¤rvi to Uusikaupunki. The landscape was beautiful and we really liked the cities of Eurajoki and Rauma.

Going to the sauna at golf clubs has now become a little tradition of ours. ðŸ˜‰_

### Overnight Stay

We slept in a somewhat hidden [shelter above / on the Uusikaupunki golf course](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5849838009). (Yes, you actually have to cross through the golf course to reach it.)

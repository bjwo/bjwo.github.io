We were on the road quite early today and had made more than 60 km before lunch even though the weather was just mediocre.

Unfortunately, Dani then had a little accident. Her bicycle had tipped over and when she raised it again she hurt her back and was in quite a bit of pain.

We tried to go to a medical center in Nora, but we were turned away, I guess because it was so close to the weekend. ðŸ™„ Fortunately, we know some great docs and after consulting them via the phone we felt safe enough to continue to Ã–rebro where we checked into a hotel with a sauna as some heat and relaxation should be good for Dani's back.

In the evening the sun came out and we had a nice picnic at Ã–rebro's most iconic sight - the castle.

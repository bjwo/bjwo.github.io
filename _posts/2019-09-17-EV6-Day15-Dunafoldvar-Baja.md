In the morning I split ways from Marike and Guus as they wanted to try their luck on the northern side of the Danube, and I wanted to go on the southern side.

It was a bit cold and overcast, but fortunately the rain predicted in the forecast did not manifest itself. There were great dedicated bike paths for most of the route today, so cycling was fairly easy.

I saw reports of other riders that one 10 km stretch was again on bad shape on top of a dike, so I rather went around it and shared the road with the cars and trucks. ðŸ˜£

Oh, and Paprikas. There were so many Paprikas everywhere. This is the Hungarian Puszta after all.

In the afternoon I got a little bored while cycling and was fiddling around on my phone, took some pictures and was researching restaurants and supermarkets on my phone, when a larger group of road cyclists passed by pretty quickly.

Suddenly I heard someone scream from within that group: "BjÃ¶rn! Hang on! Get in our slipstream!" It was my dutch friends from the night before.

We decided that we would wild camp together. So we went to a supermarket, bought some food and beer and headed for the site I had researched before.

On our way there, we saw a stranded cyclist with a broken chain. Fortunately, Guus had an extra chain link, so we were able to help him back on track. He was so happy, but couldn't speak a word of English or German. So he decided to guide our way to the camp site.

It looked really nice. The [wild camp site](https://goo.gl/maps/yWPvsfeH2fx5k7pA8) had a nice little hut and several benches and on the bank of a river. Unfortunately, the river didn't look clean enough for swimming. There was a well / water pump nearby, but when I went to the well to wash myself, a guy from the house nearby stopped me. We could communicate with some broken German. Basically, I think he told me that the water has to much iron. He ended up inviting me to use the shower in his garage.

Having a shower at the end of a cycling day is probably the biggest and nicest luxury I can think of these days.

Afterwards, the guys wife poured me a beer, which I also had to drink with them.

Their German was good enough that I cold prepare them that there would be two more Dutch cyclists coming soon - so they could also shower there.

Later we cooked dinner, and lit a fire. There was also a group of 5 curious boars, which came really close to us.

So all in all a pretty fun day.

It was raining rather heavily several times throughout the night. And the two cats (who were also not shy at all) came to visit us in our tents. It was hard to keep them away from us, really.

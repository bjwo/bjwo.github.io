Evening, love you by having beer, Marike and Guus made plans to cycle together to Belgrade and to stay in the same hostel.

It was really fun to have somebody to chat to, while riding.

there was a bigger hill, with a rather long enough which we had to conquer right in the beginning of the morning, but afterwards the roads were pretty easy. Only on the road going into Belgrade, there was a lot of traffic.

We entered the city on the Saturday. along the river bank, there was a promenade, with some attractions, food stalls and shops with kids toys. As the weather was good, pretty everybody was out here strolling along with their kids.
The timing was really good to do some people watching here. when traveling, what I like most is to see how people live, what they eat, and where they go to party, so I really liked this.

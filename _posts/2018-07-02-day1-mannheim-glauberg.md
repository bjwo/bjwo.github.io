I had a good but exhausting first day. Robert, a good friend accompanied me for the first kilometers to bid me farewell. I guess I am carrying more weight than I had expected, which took it's toll when I accidentally took a "short cut" via the Hohe Stra√üe (high road) and therefore had to climb more meters than I had planned. And then all restaurants were closed, cuz it's a Monday, go figure. Anyway, I made it and had a good first nights sleep at an old burial site for Celtic kings.

_Life on the road continues... Not much to tell: the area is very hilly which always makes for an exhausting ride and the headwind doesn't help either. ðŸ˜‰ However the sun is shining and morale is still good.
<br><br>
We cycled roughly 90 km from Valdemarsvik to VÃ¤stervik. <br>
Unfortunately the shelter we had looked out for the night was hogged by German Campervan tourists (grr), but we could find another one nearby._

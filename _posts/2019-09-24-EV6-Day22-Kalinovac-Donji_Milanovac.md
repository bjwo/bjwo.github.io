Today I passed a wildfire. At first I thought somebody was burning something in the yard, but then I have passed some pretty massive burning bushes and grass. A little later I saw a fire truck, and there were two firemen trying to put the fire out. However, The signal lights of the fire truck were not on, and it did not seem like they were waiting for some reinforcements. at the same time, the fire had almost reached a hat in someone's yard. So I'm not entirely sure what was going on but it did not seem like a controlled fire to me. I put out a little fire with my feet on the side of the road, but as they were loads of other cars passing by and nobody tried to help, I figured everything was all right. It still felt pretty weird.

Later than notes of shorter and some longer tunnels, all without lighting and with no extra room for bicyclists. however, fortunately there was not a lot of traffic, and I brought lots of reflective gear.

The night I spent again in my own room, with a balcony overlooking the Danube.

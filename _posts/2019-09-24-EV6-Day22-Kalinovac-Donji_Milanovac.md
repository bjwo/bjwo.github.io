Today I passed a wildfire. At first I thought somebody was burning something in their yard, but then I have passed some pretty massive burning bushes and grass. A little later I saw a fire truck, and there were two firemen trying to put the fire out. However, The signal lights of the fire truck were not on and it did not seem like they were waiting for some reinforcements. At the same time, the fire had almost reached a building in someone's yard. So I'm not entirely sure what was going on, but it did not seem like a controlled fire to me. I put out a little fire with my feet on the side of the road, but as they were loads of other cars passing by and nobody tried to help, I figured everything was all right and continued my trip. It still felt pretty weird.

Later there were some shorter and longer tunnels, all without any lighting and with no extra shoulder for bicyclists. Fortunately there was not a lot of traffic and I had brought lots of reflective gear. Along the way I met a french/italian guy, with dark clothing and without any lights or reflictive gear. I thought that was pretty daring of him. ;)

The night I spent again in my own room (Sobe) in a b&b, with a balcony overlooking the Danube.

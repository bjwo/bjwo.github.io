Again I split ways from Marike and Guus as they wanted to on the Serbien side of the Danube, and I wanted to go to the Croatian side. Also, I took a bit longer to get ready in the morning.

Getting close to the Croatian border, I could see a fence and huge watchtowers. I guess these are a part of the Hungarian anti-immigration politics. Strange to see such a border and having my ID checked again at an inner-European border. I thought that was a thing of the past. ðŸ¥º

As it was already a little late I used komoot to plan a route for me to Osijek to a camping place I had found. The route fine to me, and I believed it would be smooth sailing.

But oh boy, I was wrong. There were some hills in the way, and the roads komoot suggested just didn't exist. Unfortunately, I only found this out when I was almost at the top of the hills.

So back down again, and hope that the other little path gets me over the top. So I was stuck in the middle of nowhere with no water left and only one hour until sunset.

There were some really steep inclines on really bad dirt roads, but I made it and was suddenly in some lush vineyards near Vinogradi.

I ended up racing the remaining 21 km to the camp site within 45 minutes, as the receptionist was due to leave just when I was set to arrive.

I made it in time, and there was even some decent restaurant still open (showing a croatian champions league match).

_#day23: After a night of sleep on the floor together with hundreds of other polish people on M/F Wawel, I arrived in Nyn√§shamn, Sweden.
<br><br>
From hereon it was an easy cycling trip (with a surprising amount of hills) to Stockholm. Finally proper cycling roads again, I was so happy. üôÇüö¥ Once I got to Stockholm I did some laundry - having fresh and dry clothes on the road always requires a bit of planning ahead - and then did a little bit of sightseeing.
<br><br>
The guards of the king's castle wouldn't give me the password for the royal WiFi - that was a bit of a blow. üòè
<br><br>
Then I had some swedish k√∂ttbullar for dinner, bagged and washed myself at a public beach and found myself a nice park bench on a cliff near the port where my ferry to Finland is leaving the next morning. Stunning view and sunset over Stockholm.

Originally my plan was to stay directly inside the ferry terminal. However -- unfortunately it was closed during the night. So while I was sitting in front of the terminal trying to figure out where I could camp out for the night, an old guy came by on his bicycle on his little evening tour. First he passed by, but after a little while he turned around and started talking to me. He was worried that I did not have a place to sleep for the night and invited me over to his place for the night. But as my ferry left very early in the morning and it already was quite late, I did not want to take him up on his offer not to be any burden. But it was still very sweet.

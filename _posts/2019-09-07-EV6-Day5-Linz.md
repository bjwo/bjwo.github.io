There was this really cool festival going on in Linz,  [ars electronica](http://ars.electronica.art/outofthebox/en/) and in the evening there would be an art event/ show/ fireworks on the Danube called the [Linzer Klangwolke](https://klangwolke.at).

With the heavy rain predicted for the next three days, I decided to add a rest day in Linz to skip at least one day of rain to be able to visit the events. I am so glad I did - it was so cool.

In the evening I met two guys from Benin, I had briefly met two days before on their bikes. All of us from the camp site went to see the concert together in the evening.

It was really impressive and probably the biggest fireworks I have ever seen. Have a look at [this short video](https://youtu.be/ByZaM4BychA).

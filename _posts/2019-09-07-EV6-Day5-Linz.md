There was this really cool festival going on in Linz, cakes "ars electronica" and in the evening there would be an art event/ show/ fireworks on the Danube called the Linzer Klangwolke. With the heavy rain predicted, I decided to add a rest day in Linz to witness everything. I am so glad I did - it was so cool.

In the evening I met again two guys I had seen two days before in their bikes. We went to see the concert together in the evening.

It was really impressive and probably the biggest fireworks I have ever seen.

Today was the last day of cycling on our trip. We rode the remaining few kilometers to MalmÃ¶, but not without stopping at a beach for my daily swim in the Kattegatt. ðŸ˜„

Somehow for our dates all hotels were booked out, so we had the choice of going to the youth hostel for a way too high price, or for just a few Euros more, to splurge and to check in at the posh Scandic hotel. So guess what we did. We got a nice room on the tenth floor with a cool view on the Ã–resund bridge.

I took this day off from cycling as I still felt sick and was coughing quite a bit.

Included in the fee for my camping site was the entry for the thermal bath next door. So I tried to kill all bacteria by boiling myself in hot water for a day. ðŸ˜‰

Oh, and in the morning I met Max from NZ who was staying on the same camp site. He has an inflatable raft which packs down in a backpack, so he's touring the world with his little raft. Last month he'd been to Irak - now he's traveling down the Danube. We're planning to catch up downstream in Budapest.

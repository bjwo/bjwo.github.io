I took this day off from cycling as I still felt sick and was coughing quite a bit.

Included in the few for my camping place was the entry for the thermal bath next door. So I tried to kill all bacteria by biking myself for a day. ðŸ˜‰

Oh, and in the morning I met Max from NZ. He has an inflatable raft which packs down in a backpack, so he's touring the world with his little raft. Last month he'd been to Irak - now he's traveling down the Danube. We're planning to catch up in Budapest tomorrow.

_#day14: for the first 40 km or so the roads were pretty terrible and I had to fight quite hard to move ahead. To me it's unfathomable, how this can be a part of the official Eurovelo network.
<br><br>
Anyway, the landscape remains beautiful and the beach town still ask look the same, with the same shops, same small carnival, and with lots and lots of people.
<br><br>
However if you go through the national parks just a bit outside of town, you'll find beautiful long stretches of beach with hardly any people.
<br><br>
Also, I hardly meet any other Bikepackers, to my surprise.
<br><br>
After the city of Kolberg there was this AMAZING cycle road (co-financed by the EU, as most cycle roads) right along the coast, and you could see the Sea while riding. This was probably my favorite stretch on my journey this far.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I had to find a place to stay, even if I could have gone on - as there didn't seem to be any suitable camp sites ahead. So I ended up on a bigger camp site - nobody speaks English - not my most favorite place to sleep. Anyway, I got some good #pierogi and #pivo, did my laundry and watched the sunset on the beach. ðŸŒ…

Today was my longest day on a bicycle, ever (192 km!). 😁 The wind coming from behind was just amazing and I wanted to make use of it (and I guess to make up for the half lost day from yesterday).

I now did some calculations and figured out that if I hurried, I could make all the way to Constanta at the Black Sea (and thereby complete the Eastern part of the EuroVelo 6) before heading back to Bucharest for the wedding.

So I raced through the villages. I like the countryside in Romania. Lots of horse carts and friendly people in the villages. However, unfortunately also lots of trash and road kill on the side of the roads.

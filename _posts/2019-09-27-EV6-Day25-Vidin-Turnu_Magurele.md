Today was my longest day on a bicycle, ever. 😁 The wind was just amazing and I wanted to make use of it (and I guess to make up for the half lost day from yesterday).

I now did since calculations and figured that, if I hurried, I could make it in time to Constanta at the black sea and thereby complete the Eastern part of the EuroVelo 6.

So I raced through the villages. I like the countryside in Romania. Lots of horse carts and friendly people in the villages. However, unfortunately also lots of trash and road kill on the side of the roads.

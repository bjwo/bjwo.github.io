_#day12: almost made it to the Baltic Sea. Again I rode a bit on former railway tracks (Bahnradweg), that is the most wonderful thing for cyclists: straight, no steep inclines or curves, great road surface, beautiful surrounding. 😍🚂 I pitched my tent up at the harbor in Anklam, and there are now many other cyclists around.

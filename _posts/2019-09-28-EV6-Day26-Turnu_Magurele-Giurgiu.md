I continued racing through the landscape.

No matter where you stop to eat a little snack, it won't be long, before some cat shows up out of nowhere, begging for food. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Regarding the dogs I made the following observation: the real wild stay dogs are always really chill and won't bother you.
Only if somebody forgets to close a gate to their house as a dog gets out, they start to chase you. At least so far I've been quite lucky and was always able to outrun the dogs.

In the evening I met three other bike tourers, who had met along the way and we now cycling together. They were just about to find a place at the river to sleep, and I was very tempted to join them.
However, I didn't join them, as I had already made a reservation at a motel north of Giurgiu and on the other hand I knew it would slow me down to camp and to chat to other nice folks.

It is a lot harder to find decent accommodation for a good price in Romania. Serbia was much, much better in that regard.

The motel was a bit weird. The old owner was drunk and cooking with his family in the "lobby". They all couldn't speak any English, but getting around using Google translate works very well these days.

Anyway, he told me to park my bike on some shed behind the building, which couldn't even be locked. When I tried to lock my bike inside, he got angry and told me that nothing ever got stolen there and he gave me his family's guarantee. So I didn't dare to take it to my room - but I felt very uneasy about it, as this was in the middle of nowhere next to a motorway.

The room itself, was very nice and clean, however. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

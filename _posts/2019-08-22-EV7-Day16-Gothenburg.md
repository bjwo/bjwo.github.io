We used the day for more sightseeing in Gothenburg, laundry and making a decision on how to proceed with our cycling trip:

We originally had planned to take the ferry from Gothenburg over to Denmark, and then to cycle along the [north sea cycleway in Denmark](http://northseacycleroute.dk/home/) towards Germany.

However, there is also the [Kattegatleden](https://kattegattleden.se/en/) (or EuroVelo13) along the swedish west coast from Göteborg to Malmö.

We decided to follow the Kattegatleden, as we think we might visit Denmark explicitly for a cycle holiday at some point in the future. However, we probably wouldn't go to Sweden to cycle along the west coast  anytime soon. So we decided to do that now and will mount our bikes again tomorrow morning.

Cross your fingers that the weather will be better than what the predictions say. As much luck as we had with the swedish weather last year, as unlucky we've been this year and had unusually much rain and cool temperatures.

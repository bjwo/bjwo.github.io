_So I am now a day late with yesterday's report. We cycled from NÃ¤rpes to Sideby through the swedish-speaking parts of Finland. To me, as a part Finlandswede, it is really interesting to explore my mother's heritage and to hear the minority language spoken everywhere. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>
Unfortunately, there are not many dedicated cycle roads outside the towns, so we have to ride a lot of country roads on the shoulder. However most of the drivers are very respectful and leave a lot of room when passing.
<br><br>
Sometimes you can find old wells in the side of the road. We use them to wash ourselves, much to the interest of the locals.<br>
For the night we ended up setting up our tent on a bird watching tower 20 meters above the ground with a superb view over the sea and treetops, but also a lot of wind and therefore a bit shaky throughout the night ðŸ˜‰. This was definitely of the most interesting places I've slept so far._

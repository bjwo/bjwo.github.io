_Today was another challenging ride. Not because of the weather, but we made quite some distance (112 km) and climbed 980 hm up and down some hills.
<br><br>
Unfortunately we started to have some issues with our bikes again and some of our gears aren't working properly - so our first trip tomorrow morning will be to the local bike shop.
<br><br>
The area doesn't sport any shelters, so we're staying at a grill spot on the coast near the city._

_Thank you Berlin it was lovely to take a little break here (and again special thanks to Daniel and Anne for having me). I used my time well and met some friends, did some fixes to my bike, had great food and hid from the rain. Now it's time to go on towards the Baltic sea and Gdansk in Poland. #cycle2finland #deutschlandperrad #icanrideclearlynowtherainisgone_

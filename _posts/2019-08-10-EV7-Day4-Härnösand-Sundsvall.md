We started the day with breakfast on the beach before leaving Härnösand southbound.
As we continued our tour a bit more inland we felt as if we were in the Black Forest: rolling hills with small farming villages and a few cows here and there. Once in a while we encountered a lake or a small creek.
After about 50 km we entered the civilized world again and stopped for a late lunch in Timrå. 
As our legs were a bit tired and the weather was supposed to turn we only continued to Sundsvall and spent a little time in the city center.

We then continued to a lake nearby called Sidsjön, where we found a shelter for the night - even had a hot "shower" with water from the public restrooms.
We put up our tent just in time as it started raining again... Unfortunately it turned out that the shelter was not quite rainproof and there were bigger drops drumming on the sheet metal roof all night. So we didn't sleep too well that night.

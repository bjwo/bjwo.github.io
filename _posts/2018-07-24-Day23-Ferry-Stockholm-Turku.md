_#day23 Yesterday was again a boat day, which means, I made it to Finland! 🤗🇫🇮✌️ Fortunately, I met Lasse - a Finish guy living in Stockholm - on the boat, and we had a long great chat over some beers. This shortened the otherwise lengthy trip and made it really fun. <br>
In the evening I was pretty tired, so I again made use of the #allmansrätten and found myself a quite spot in the woods and put up my hamock. As it turned out in the morning, it was rather close to the local cross-country skiing track, heavily used by local mom's (nordic walkers??) for walking in the morning. 😉

Also, unfortunately, one mount of my front lowrider broke off, so I need to go and fix that now.

### Overnight Stay

I slept in my hammock [here somewhere in the woods](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/24911725) (unfortunately there was a surprising amount of joggers and power walkers).

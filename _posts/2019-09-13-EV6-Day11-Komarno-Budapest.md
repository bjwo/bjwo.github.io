Still a little sick, but not sick enough to stay another day. I pushed on through to Budapest today, which means that I'm in Hungary now!

Unfortunately, I already got a little taste on the rest of the trip today: the large majority of the route I had to share the road with the cars. I was a bit surprised by this, as the tire from Vienna to Budapest is very popular with cycling tourists - and I saw write a few bike tourists on their rented bikes, too. So I really would have expected a nicer route.
Unfortunately, I can't show you, as taking pictures with the overtaking cars and trucks really wouldn't be safe.

The chapel in Esztergom was really pretty.

Along the way I met Nick - a Dutch guy who's cycling to his own wedding in Novi Sad, Serbia. We started talking and even had a nice dinner / beer togethet in Szentendre, before we had to split ways. Bit we might catch up again later.

Italready gets dark quite early now and so I entered Budapest in the dark. What a beautiful sight - such a picturesque city!
12 years ago I spent a whole summer here for work and being here brought so many memories back to life. It is so nice to be back.

_I'm on a boat to Sweden! Goodbye Gdansk, it was lovely. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±ðŸš¢ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª_
{: .notice}

Important to note: The ferry to Sweden goes from the harbour on the Westerplatte side -- I had a hard time figuring that out as it wasn't noted anywhere, and nobody from Polferries answered the phone.

### Overnight Stay

I slept on the floor on the [M/F Wawel](https://polferries.com/our-ferries/mf-wawel.html) with tons of Polish truck drivers.

_Gdansk... Such a beautiful city! üòç_
{: .notice}

I had some very nice days in Gdansk.

First, I had a hard time finding a cycle shop as I was looking for a shop to drill out the old, broken screw - but the cycle shops wouldn't & couldn't help me, and did not even want to give a recommendation on where I could go to have it fixed. I guess the shops in the inner city were busy enough with renting out cycles to tourists. üôÅ I ended up in a small cycle shop - and the owner ended up builind a little workaround for me: He used different, higher holes for the screws holding the bicycle carrier, and then used some spacers above the dirt guard to account for the height difference. Somehow I hadn't thought of that myself. And this workaround proved quite sturdy, and so it works like this to this day. üòé

My girlfriend was flying in to Helsinki at the end of the month -- and I did not have enough time to make it to Estonia to take the ferry to Helsinki from there. I might have been able to make it, but after experiencing the bad road conditions in Poland, I did not want to risk it. Also I did not have a visa for Kaliningrad, so I would have needed to find a way to bring my bicycle and luggage either on a train or bus to Lithuania.

So I chose to take the ferry from Gda≈Ñsk to Nyn√§shams (south of Stockholm) and to take the ferry from Stockholm to Turku in Finland. I felt more comfortable this way.

This gave me three days to kill in Gda≈Ñsk, as the ferry only went every second day and I didn't want to leave Gda≈Ñsk already on the next day. I had a great time: nice people in my hostel, great food and cheap beer.

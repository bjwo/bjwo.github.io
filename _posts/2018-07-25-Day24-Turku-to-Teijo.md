_#day24 started a bit late and first I had to run some errands like getting a Finnish SIM card and fixing my lowrider. Unfortunately, a rather special part broke (I guess due to the very shaky roads in northern Poland and Saxony), and I wasn't able to find a proper replacement, so again I did it using my McGuyver skills. 😉
<br><br>
Then my first entertaining moment was when I saw the young guy who had passed me very fast using his e-Chopper-bike, and he had run out of batteries. Those are the little things that make you happy on a bike. 😂
<br><br><
I am now riding the Western King's Road, the most important route from Russia to Sweden in former times. And it's so much fun to ride on these great Finnish cycle roads! 😍
<br><br>
Today I had reattached ahead of time where I want to sleep, as you need to plan a bit more here in Finland where civilization Max be a bit more sparse.
I had found a shelter on a little island in a national park, with a shelter with a fireplace, dry toilet and a swimmable sweet water lake. The last kilometer wasn't suitable for bicycles, however not worse than Polish roads. 😉 And I was so glad I made it there. You had to pull yourself to the island using a little ferry and everything was so nice and calm.
<br><br>
The swim in the evening was amazing and I set up my hammock right by the lake. This was definitely one of the highlights of my trip so far.

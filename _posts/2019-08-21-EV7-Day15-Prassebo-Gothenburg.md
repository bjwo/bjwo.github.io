The headwind was still going strong today. To avoid the rain we didn't follow the Sverigeleden into Göteborg, but decided to take the (way) less scenic shortcut along the highway / along the _Göta Kanal_.

Once we had checked in and took a shower we used the remaining day for sightseeing.

Göteborg is clearly a cycle city with lots of dedicated bike lanes - and they're heavily used, too. We love it!

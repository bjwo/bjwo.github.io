The headwind was still going strong today. To avoid the rain to the east of us, we didn't follow the official Sverigeleden route into Göteborg, but decided to take the (way) less scenic shortcut along the highway and along the _[Göta Kanal](https://www.gotakanal.se/en/)_.

Once we had checked in and took a shower we used the remaining day for sightseeing.

Göteborg is clearly a cycle city with lots of dedicated bike lanes - and they're heavily used, too. We love it!

I mainly used my time in Budapest to revisit old places, drink some beer, meet done people, eat good food and to relax. It was great. Plenty of tourists here, though - I guess as a local I'd be pretty annoyed.

Oh, and unfortunately the cycling infrastructure sucks here. ðŸ˜” It's pretty hard to get around on a bike. Even if there are sometimes painted bike lanes, they often suddenly stop and leave you abandoned in the middle of the car and bus traffic.

We were _really_ lucky to get a spare part for Dani's rear derailleur and to find a mechanic willing to fix her bicycle. Thanks to our ADFC / Roland bike insurance, our nights in the fancy Best Western hotel in Vasastan were covered while the bike was being repaired - and so we had ample time to explore the beautiful city.

### Overnight Stay

We slept in the [Time Hotel](https://www.timehotel.se/) in Stockholm.

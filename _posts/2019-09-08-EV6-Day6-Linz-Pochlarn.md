Fortunately, the weather didn't turn out as gloomy as predicted. 

Cycling out from Linz, a girl on a road bike passed me slowly. I took this as a welcome opportunity to stay in her slipstream for a while. 😄

In the mean time I even saw some sun and met another cyclist on a ferry. We stayed together and chatted for 2h. This happens with often, it's quite different to meet so many people here, compared to the swedish countryside.

In the evening and night there was some rain predicted again. Fortunately, I found a Naturfreundehaus - and I could have a bed there for only 12€. The lady was so friendly, too. It was a really nice experience.
Nobody else showed up- so I had the whole house for myself.

I also treated myself to a pretty big burger that night. I think it was the last day of the Austrian school summer holiday, and that burger place was PACKED! I believe every student from a 50 km radius was there that night. 😁

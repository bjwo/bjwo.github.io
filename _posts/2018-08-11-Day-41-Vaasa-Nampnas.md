_Today was the first day cycling with my girlfriend. And oh boy, we were off to a rough ride: there was a strong storm-like headwind all day with wind gushes up to 80 km/h all day. We still managed to do close to 100km today, very proud. 😊💪🌬️ We found a quite and cozy spot for our tent on a beach on a little island near Närpes. 🏕️🚴‍♀️🚴💨<br><br>
Oh, and we cycled around a gigantic meteorite crater near Vaasa today, that was very impressive._

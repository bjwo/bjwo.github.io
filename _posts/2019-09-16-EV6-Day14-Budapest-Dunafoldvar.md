The route out of Budapest was surprisingly good: good roads and signage. I found it strange that the route into the city was so bad in comparison, as I believe more tourists would go on direction of Vienna.

The first part followed an old sidearm of the Danube. Here there were so many villas and cottages. And it seems that pretty much everyone here owns their own little jetty with a bench for fishing. Really lovely area.

Also, I found out interesting that in some areas there were numerous freshwater wells at the side of the road which were free to use. I since they are from times when not every house had their own water connection.

Later in the afternoon the roads got significantly worse: for many kilometres the road was now following a small path on top of a dike. That cost me more time than I had expected.

Also it starts to get dark at 7 now so when you need to factor in that you have to spend the mornings drying your tent and packing everything, then you don't have so much time left for cycling in the daytime.

So so I rolled into some campsite at dawn and fortunately I met a very nice couple from the Netherlands there: Marieke and Guus. They were the only people there.

They joined me for a beer at a nearby restaurants where I had some very mediocre fish and chips. We had a long nice chat about our cycling trips, and it turned out that they are also heading towards the Black Sea on their tandem.

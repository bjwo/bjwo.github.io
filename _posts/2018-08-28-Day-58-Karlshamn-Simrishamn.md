_The weather got better and we made a push into Sweden's apple region yesterday. 🍎🇸🇪 We found a new shelter which was built this year and fortunately, due to the rain, the fire ban has finally been lifted. 🔥🔥🔥 Also, I'm getting a bit sentimental, as this was the last night in the wild on this trip.
<br><br>
Today we'll move on to Trelleborg from where we'll take the ferry back to Germany.

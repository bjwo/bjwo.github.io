_Yesterday was a tough day. It started with rain (which we anticipated and dressed for), and it ended with an unanticipated, surprising heavy (!!!) rain storm in which we got complete drenched.
<br><br>
The phone was so wet, it was tough to navigate. Also not many pictures from this day.
<br><br>
After plentiful hills, at the end of the day we took a wrong turn, and had to backtrack up a steep incline through the heavy rainstorm.
<br><br>
We ultimately made it to a shelter on a cliff above the seaside. We put up inner tent inside the shelter, which has become our new default way of staying in the wild.
<br><br>
Nonetheless, we still managed to do our 95km with 800hm. ðŸ’ª_

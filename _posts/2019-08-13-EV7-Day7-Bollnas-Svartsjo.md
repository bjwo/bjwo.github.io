Again another challenging day with two long climbs - one on a rough gravel road - and overall almost 1200 hm.

Sure to the forecast we had expected to cycle in the rain today - but we got lucky and didn't get a single drop today.

And we found a beautiful brand new shelter directly on the shore of a national park, which wasn't on any of the maps we checked and witnessed a beautiful sunset. Getting the tent set up was a tight fit, but we managed with some workarounds. ðŸ˜‰

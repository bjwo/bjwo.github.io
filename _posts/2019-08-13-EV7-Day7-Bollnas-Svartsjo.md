Again another challenging day with two long climbs - one on a rough gravel road - and overall almost 1200 hm.

According to the forecast we had expected to cycle in the rain today - but we got lucky and didn't get a single drop today.

We saw our second moose/elk lady today! And this time we have proof. Fascinating and scary at the same time, if you don't have a car as shelter surrounding you.

And we found a beautiful brand new shelter directly on the shore of a national park, which wasn't on any of the maps we checked and witnessed a beautiful sunset. Getting the tent set up was a tight fit, but we managed with some workarounds. ðŸ˜‰

_#day6: ride from the Saale river to the next (but last) Luther-City. It felt so hot this day, that I had decided to deviate a bit from my planned route, in order to spend the night at a camping site on a lake a little south of Wittenberg. However the roads to get there were so terrible - in the countryside over miles and miles there are cobblestone highways. Now it seems clear to me that Hitler must have hated cyclists as well.<br>
My new route led me through Gr√§fenhainichen - however, it turned out that there was a gigantic Hip Hop festival going on, and I couldn't pass. So I had to find a detour, which turned out to be s little tricky.<br>
Then I got to the camp site, which was WAY two crowded for my taste, so I decided to go on to Wittenberg.
<br>
Wittenberg is a really pretty town, unfortunately I didn't have to much time to explore it in-depth. I had dinner at a restaurant before heading to my designated shelter for the night - which, as it turned out wasn't a shelter after all, bit a simple picnick table. So I had to improvise. #cycle2finland #deutschlandperrad #111km #660hm

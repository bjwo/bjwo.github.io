_#day26: so, another day of cycling in the Finnish heat with lots and lots of hills. #hÃ¼gelignichthyggeligt
<br><br>
Actually, it is so hot that I had to take an hour's break in an air conditioned supermarket to cool down in the middle of the day. I know, in Germany it's worse (temperature-wise) right now, but with all the bags on my bike and the hills, I'm struggling a bit here as well. ðŸ˜Š Maybe there's also a bit of polish sand still stuck in my bottom bracket.
<br><br>
Fortunately, I don't have to make a lot of kilometers at the moment, as I only have to be in Helsinki in Sunday to fetch Dani from the airport, so I am taking it a bit slow. ðŸ˜Š
<br><br>
In the evening I found a nice swimming beach and that is where I set up my tent and experienced and amazing sunset. And I don't think I ever met this many Finlandswedes in the wild before - that's kind of fun. ðŸ˜‚

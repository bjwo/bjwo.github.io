_The first 1000km are done. 🎉🎉🎉 Heading into Poland now. 🇩🇪🚲🇵🇱 #cycle2finland<br><br>
#day13: I'm a bit late with the report on yesterday. I started out in Anklam and quickly made my way over to island Usedom. Theres a pretty cool riseable railway bridge, which is still a remnant of WW2: The Nazis rose the bridge upon their retreat before and destroyed the bridge bases to prevent the Soviets from moving on towards Berlin. The bridge remains in this elevated state since then.
<br><br>
Then I crossed over to Poland and saw the Baltic Sea for the first time on this journey. 😍
<br><br>
Also, I am now following the Eurovelo 10 #ev10 cycle trail. Unfortunately, The road conditions are quite terrible for bike tourists, as there are long stretches of deep sandy roads through the woods, or old military cobblestone roads over miles and miles - less than ideal if you carry four bags and a tent on your bike. The only alternative is riding the highway without cycleways, where I would probably be killed by some truck driving maniac rather sooner than later.<br>
Also, all the beach towns are very touristic and they are PACKED during this time, as it's holiday season in Poland. And the touristic mile looks like it could be anywhere in the world.
<br><br>
However, there are lots of beautiful national parks and long stretches of amazing sand beaches with no people for miles. So that makes up for it all. 😊
<br><br>
I made my way to a little camp site on a farm as I try to avoid the touristic party camp sites and after some locals discouraged me from staying at a picnic site due to some aggressive boars. A young dad and his son immediately invited me over for dinner with dal and rice, which was amazing. You meet so many nice and interesting people when traveling.
<br><br>
Oh, and in the morning I woke up to a dog peeing on my tent. 😑

I left the hostel rather early. Which proved futile, because on the way I found a shop which had the had cartridge - but only opened later. So I had to hang out for one hour in front of the shop.

For the route I had to choose riding on the dam in a bad shape, or to ride on the highway. I chose the latter one and made it to the ferry earlier than expected.

The weather was also on my side - and fortunately it didn't rain all day.

The ferry was rather interesting: it didn't have it's own motor, and it docked to the land by shoveling dirt and gravel in between the ferry and the land.

I made it to a nice little camp site on the other side of the river. The standard price for a room here always seems to be the equivalent of 10â‚¬ in SRB.

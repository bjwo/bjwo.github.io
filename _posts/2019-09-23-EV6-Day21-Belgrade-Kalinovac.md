I left the hostel rather early. Which proved futile, because on the way I found a shop which had the had cooking gas cartridges - but only opened later. So I had to hang out for one hour in front of the shop and had some breakfast.

A little later, when exiting the suburbs of Belgrade I had to choose between riding on the dam - where the road was in a very bad shape, or to ride on the highway. I chose the latter one and made it to the ferry across the Danube in Stara Planka earlier than expected. Note: the [ferry crossing point is here](https://goo.gl/maps/fMPHJ3cfb2XXWts89), in contrast what the maps make you believe.

The weather was also on my side - and fortunately it didn't rain all day - in contrast to what the weather report had predicted.

The ferry was rather interesting: it didn't have it's own motor, and it docked to the land by shoveling dirt and gravel in between the ferry and the land.

I made it to a nice little camp site on the other side of the river. The standard price for a room here in the Serbian countryside always seems to be the equivalent of 10â‚¬ in SRB.

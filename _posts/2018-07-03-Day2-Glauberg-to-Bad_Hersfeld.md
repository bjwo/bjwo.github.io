_#day2 went really smooth. For the first part of the day I followed the Vulkanradweg, which followed the former tracks of a railroad. It was a steady climb over a stretch of 30km and it is so beautiful here! I can highly recommend this route. If I am not mistaken, this was already the highest point of my whole route. ðŸ¤“ In the afternoon I found a swimming pool, had a proper shower, took a dip, did some laundry, stocked up my supplies before taking on the last 20km to the outdoor shelter before the gates of Bad Hersfeld, where I spent my night. #111km #880hm #cycle2finland ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸš²ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®_

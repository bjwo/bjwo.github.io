The weather forecast is pretty unreliable here. I woke up for the app to say that there wouldn't be any rain all day, however it was still raining, and it was raining the whole morning until I had lunch.

despite the rain, this was probably the most beautiful part of the route so far. I passed the most narrow and deepest part of the Danube today, with done really beautiful sights.

I made it until Negotin, where I stayed in the Urban Guerilla Hostel. The host was simply amazing, and it is such a cozy place. If you're cycling the EuroVelo 6, you have to stay here!

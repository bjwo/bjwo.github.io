The weather forecast is pretty unreliable here. I woke up for the app to say that there wouldn't be any rain all day, however it was raining, and it kept raining the whole morning until I had lunch.

Despite the rain, this was probably the most beautiful part of my trip along the Danube so far. I passed the most narrow and deepest part of the Danube at the Iron Gates today, with some really beautiful sights along the way.

I made it until Negotin, where I stayed in the [very lovely Urban Guerilla Hostel](https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgoIgbyNiOPStq5YEAE/) - a place ideal for people touring on two wheels. The host was simply amazing, and it is such a cozy place. If you're cycling the EuroVelo 6, you have to stay here!

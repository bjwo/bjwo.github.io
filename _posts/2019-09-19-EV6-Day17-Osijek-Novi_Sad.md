In the morning a cycled into the city of Osijek. My new Hungarian SIM card still wasn't working, and I really wanted to find out why, as I would be without any data connection otherwise. I lost another hour trying to get it to work: In the end I had to send some special code, which was not documented and any of the official T-Mobile Hungary documentation. I was really annoyed that I had lost time again.

The roads in Croatia were ok, but only because they were directly on the highway. The signage for the route was weird: in places where you would need a sign (intersections), there were none. However in places where you didn't need them, like after riding on a straight highway for 10 km, there were plenty of them.

I made it across the border to Serbia rather late in the afternoon. I was greeted by a very friendly EuroVelo sign. The signage is great here in Serbia. Sometimes they even provide alternative routes, so you may choose whether you want to ride with the cars on the highway, or if you want to take a less busy roads, where the road conditions are a lot worse usually.

So I chose the roads with the cars in order to get to the city of Novi Sad more quickly. The last 15 km or so into Novi Sad, there was a wonderful dedicated cycle path. It begins even before there are official signs, so if you're heading that way, it would be good to research that.

The hostel I booked had messed up the reservation for my single room, however they were kind enough to block five other beds of a six bed dormroom, which I now have for myself for the next two nights. Or more precisely: my bicycle and myself. I didn't want to park it downstairs in the street.

Across the street I had to really nice meat-heavy meal, with lots of raw onions as well.

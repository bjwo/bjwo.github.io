Today we reserved some time to do sightseeing in Helsingborg, so we didn't push through to Malmö just yet.

This even gave us some time to spend some time at a Helsingborg city beach with a nice view on Denmark and the ferries shuttling between Helsingborg and Helsingør.

Unfortunately, this already brought us to the end of the Kattegattleden. We really enjoyed it and can highly recommend it.

In the evening we again could have a quick shower at a guest harbor and then found a beautiful shelter directly on the beach. Unfortunately, it was already occupied by a group of 4 German students, who were also on a bike trip, and they kindly offered to share the shelter with us.

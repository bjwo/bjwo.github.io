So we left Mari's home in the morning, went to the airport and we were **SO** happy and relieved that Dani's bike had arrived and was waiting there for us. We assembled the bike and rode to the Tikkurila train station before taking the train to Vaasa.

My mom is from Vaasa and my grandma still lives there so we spent some time there and said hi to her.

_#day4 went well. I rode from Eisenach via Gotha to Erfurt where I did a little sightseeing and had dinner. Then I continued north and could shower at a lake close to the shelter I had looked out for the night. And just in time before the rain started I got there. Unfortunately there were some ants, so I decided to put up my hamock tonight.
Just 15 meters away is the exact spot where Martin Luther was struck by lightning 503 years ago. The resulting visions caused him to start the Christian Protestant religion.

Even though there was a lot of rain this night and, I did not get struck by lightning, so I won't share that same fate, I guess. #cycle2finland #93km #503hm_

Today was a great day. (Apart from the tiredness due to the sleepless night in the hostel.) The sun was out, temperatures were up and the route was fun to ride.

There was a little headwind - so when two elderly locals passed me on their e-bikes I decided to leech onto them to stay in the slipstream. I just told them that I intended do so - which started a lengthy conversation. üòÅ

However, they gave me some really valuable information. They are currently building a newer Eurovelo 6 route on top of a flood protection dam. However, there were numerous pretty intimidating signs and fences prohibiting cyclists from taking the new road.
The older guy told me that he had cycled the route to Bratislava a month before and that it was completed, however not opened yet as some politicians want to do a opening ceremony first.

And besides dinner very minor pieces he was right. The route went for 20 km straight through some beautiful nature reserve, so that was really nice and shaved off some nasty re-routes through villages and along roads with car traffic.

So I got into Bratislava in the afternoon. I booked myself a bed in a hostel again, hoping that I will have better luck with my roomies tonight.

I really love the city so far. It is far less touristic than Vienna, and I really appreciate that. Another big plus: the food is great and the beer is really cheap. üòÅüçª

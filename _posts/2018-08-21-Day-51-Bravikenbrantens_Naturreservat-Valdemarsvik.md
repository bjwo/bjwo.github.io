_The day after the rain went much better. We had a complete day of sunshine, were able to dry all of our clothes on our bicycles and we had a nice ride through a beautiful scenery. Made around 100 km that day. There are so so many hills, it's a constant rollercoaster.
<br><br>
We slept at a shelter on a lake. Unfortunately, we only realized after putting up our tent inside, but there was a wasp nest, and then we realized that there was a hornet's nest on the toilet. But they didn't care for us and let us be, so we had a nice and quite night anyhow._

### Overnight Stay

We slept in a [nice shelter here somewehere](https://osm.org/go/0Y7mU8Dw). The shelter isn't listed anymore now. When we got there, the way to the shelter was fenced off with a live electrical wire and there were cow excrements everywhere. So at first we didn't dare to stay there for the night, and were headed for the next shelter we could locate. On the way there, I started talking to a local. She said that the shelter site had been abused as a party location and therefore had been fenced off - and that she thought that we should be fine to stay there for the night. So we returned there, had a swim from the pier and a restful, quite night.

_Yesterday we rode from Oskarshamn to Kalmar, around 90 km. The day started off with trying to fix our bikes. As it turned out, the only cycle shop in town had gone bankrupt. After asking some locals we got a hint that there's some old guy in a backyard fixing bikes. After searching a little, we could actually find his garage, but he turned us away that he couldn't fix our "modern bikes". However I could convince him to let me use his tools, and then he left us there while he took his dog for a walk.<br>
Anyway, i could fix mine (yay!!), but I couldn't figure out what's wrong with Dani's gears.

In the afternoon there were some bigger rain showers, but we were fortunate to dodge most and stayed relatively dry.
<br>
The evening ended with a shower & laundry in a gym, shopping and then looking for a shelter we had found on the web.
<br>
Really nice site, again close to the sea, and with an amazing (almost) full moon._

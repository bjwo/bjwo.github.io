_Aaand we're back on the road again. After spending three days in Stockholm we were able to get Dani's bike fixed again - this also gave us ample time to do some sightseeing in the beautiful city. üòç
<br>
So we made it out through the suburbs to the South and will now cycle along the coast. The shelter we had looked out beforehand was not accessible by bike, but we found shelter from the rain under the roof of a shooting range._

### Overnight Stay

We slept in a shooting range stand [here somewhere](https://osm.org/go/0aV4KMCz9-?layers=C) as we couldn't find a way to the nearby shelter we were actually planning for.

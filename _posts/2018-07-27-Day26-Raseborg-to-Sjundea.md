_#day27 My journey along the Western King's Road continues. Little history lesson: "The King's Road was part of a Medieval mail road that stretched from Bergen in today's Norway to Vyborg in today's Russia. The King's Road itself referred to the easternmost part of the route, eastwards from Turku." So the weather was so hot today, some head wind and I had to climb 740 hm with lots of hills again over a distance of 74 km. Everything seems a bit slower under these conditions.
<br><br>
In the evening I made it to a swimming lake very popular with the locals - especially because there is a 5 and 10 m tower to jump into the lake. Fortunately around midnight the last kids disappeared and I had a very nice night in my hamock directly on the lake. ðŸ˜Š

I got to see a bit of the blood moon and it was beautiful; however hard to capture with just s cell phone. ðŸŒ™

In the morning, Dani's back was better, but still not good yet. And then there was a rain front coming, so we decided to prolong the stay in our hotel for one more night and to do some sightseeing.

There was a food / farmers market which was insanely crowded. And then there was a nice classical concert. Also, currently there is the _Open Art_ festival going on with exhibits throughout the city.

There were rain showers throughout the day, some of them quite heavy - so we were happy to have made the right choice to spend an extra day in the city.

_We rode from Kalmar to Jämjö yesterday, ca. 95 km. 
Wer really liked the city of Kalmar, one of the oldest swedish cities. Did a little bit of sightseeing, and found a bike shop that would take a look at Dani's Bike - unfortunately they also couldn't figure out where the weird sound is coming from.
<br><br>
We have left the hilly Småland and are now in an area with wide plain fields - leaving us exposed for the strong headwind.
<br><br>
One funny thing: we met Doro on our route by accident - a lady bikepacking from Munich. I had already met her a month ago between Turku and Helsinki, but she was going the other direction then. Funny how small the world is sometimes.
<br><br>
We made it to a shelter rather early yesterday, which was a good thing, as shortly after we set up camp the rain started, and it got stronger throughout the night._

### Overnight Stay

We slept at a shelter close to the bridge to Öland.

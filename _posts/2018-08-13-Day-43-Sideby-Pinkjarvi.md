_Yesterday we cycled from our bird watchtower to Pinkjärvi - Pink Lake - near Eurajoki. Unfortunately, it has now cooled down quite a bit in Finland after many hot weeks, and we have now a typical finnish summer with rain and lots of wind at around 17°C. 😉
<br><br>
We did a lunch break at a Golf club in Björneborg / Pori - and the caddie master there was so kind to let us use their Sauna and showers for free - much appreciated after riding through the cold rain. We felt like reborn.<br> 
But the hardest part was still ahead of us, as we learned.<br>
<br>
All in all we rode 128 km and 890 hm - and had to climb some unexpected hills in very (!) bad terrain (the map data failed us once again: ”mostly flat" / "well developed roads") at the end to reach our shelter. It was a tough fight for both of us, and Dani fought even harder - and won! 💪💪💪 We were rewarded with an amazing sunset as you can see from the pictures._

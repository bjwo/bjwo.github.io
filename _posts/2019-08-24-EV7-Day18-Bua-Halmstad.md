The beautiful weather continues. We're now cycling through a holiday region where many swedes have some little cabins on the seaside. And after a relatively long dinner everybody was outside and enjoying a late summer.

We also went to the beach for a short while, ate great ice cream and I took a dive into the sea.

We made it to Halmstad, where we first took a shower in the guest harbor (a lady was nice enough to give us the PIN code) before we found a shelter at an artificial lake created as wildlife reservoir for some birds.
We watched an amazing sunset with flocks of geese taking off and coming back again and again. They were quite loud and unfortunately kept me from sleeping well.

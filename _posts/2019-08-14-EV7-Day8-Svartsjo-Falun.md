Today we only did the remaining few kilometers to Falun. We expected a rain day, and so we booked a hotel, with a sauna and made the best of it.

First we visited the Falun mines. They are a UNESCO World Heritage site and accounted for 2/3 of Europe's copper consumption for a long period. Basically, this is the reason why Sweden could afford to fight bigger wars in European history. All in all a very impressive site, a really cool tour and learnt a lot about swedish history.

Then we went back to our hotel, did some laundry, went to the sauna, had dinner and are now trying to figure out how to get to Göteborg from here. Unfortunately, there is no clear recommendation from roughly three routes we could take.

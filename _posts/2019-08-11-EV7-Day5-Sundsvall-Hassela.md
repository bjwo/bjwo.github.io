We did not get much sleep last night... Our vindskydd roof was leaking and the strong wind blew the rain right into our shelter. Thus our tent was wet in the morning.
Furthermore, a couple of teenagers who went for a midnight swim in the rain kept us awake.
So we were not very excited about cycling in the rain. Even more so since we knew that we were now about leave the coast for good and the next considerable village - Hassela - was 50 km and about 600 hm away. 
However, it had stipped raining and the weather prognosis promised only little more rain and even some sunshine for the afternoon.

As we reached Hassela, we were soaked, tired and hungry. Therefore we decided to stay in the local hostel (Vandrarhem). It's a very nice place that we happen to have all to ourselves. We were able to do or laundry and dry our stuff in a special drying wardrobe thing.
We did get to see the sun later. But given the violent rain showers throughout afternoon, it was a wise decision to stay in...

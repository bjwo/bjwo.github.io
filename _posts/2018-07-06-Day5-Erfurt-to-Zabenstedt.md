_#day5: lots of corn fields, Martin Luther everywhere, many hills however few people and hardly any bikepackers. Made it beyond Eisleben, birthplace of Martin Luther. On the last segment there were some bigger hills to climb, but I noticed it's getting easier, yay. <br>
Typically I try to find shelters to sleep in on OpenStreetMap, but in this region no shelters could be found. So I asked some fire fighters, who were just eating the local football field because it hasn't rained in over 6 weeks here if they knew any.
<br><br>
Instead they invited me to beer, sausages, a shower, to sleep on the soccer field or fire station and refused any kind of help or donation in return. Thanks, guys!
<br><br>
So tonight I am sleeping on the side lines of a soccer field. âš½_

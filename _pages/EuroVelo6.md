At the beginning of October 2019 I am invited to a wedding in Bucharest, Romania. As I try to reduce my flights as much as I can, the only logical way for me to get there was by bicycle. So this September I will ride the EuroVelo 6 along the Danube river and if all goes well, I will pass through the cities of Ulm, Passau, Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest, Belgrad and finally Bucarest.

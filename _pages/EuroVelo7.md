title: "EuroVelo 7: Cycle from Umeå to Germany"
excerpt: "In August 2019, my girlfriend Dani and I have a month to cycle along the EuroVelo 7 towards Germany. We started with a week's vacation in Vaasa, Finnland to see my grandma. From there we took the ferry to Umeå in Sweden and followed (mostly) the EuroVelo 7 and the Kattegatleden to Malmö and then took the bus back home to Mannheim from Copenhagen."

# Route

![EuroVelo 7 Route - August 2019](/assets/images/EuroVelo7/ev7-route.png)

# Motivation for this tour

Boundary conditions:
- my grandma lives in Finland
- my girlfriend's a teacher who had the month of August off from school
- I love cycling
- I had saved up some extra time at work
- we liked the possibility to camp in the wild like we did in Sweden last year

# Equipment on this tour

This will be my second bigger bike trip after the trip to Finland we/I did [last year](../EuroVelo10/). So we could reuse a lot of equipment from least year. However, as I had a bike accident last November and my bike was trashed, I now own a fancy new bike.

So here are some key componets:

- **Cycle:** [VSF Fahradmanufaktur T700 Disc](https://www.fahrradmanufaktur.de/en/katalog/t-700-shimano-deore-xt-30-gang-disc-807-2019)
- **Tent:** [CAMPZ Lacanau Zelt 2P](https://www.campz.de/campz-lacanau-zelt-2p-grey-green-887322.html)
    I was also really satisfied with this tent. Price to weight/size ration is really good. Only downside is that you have to build the inner tent before you can build the outer tent - which could be a downside when putting it up in heavy rain.
- **Air mattress:** Decathlon [Trek 700 XL gelb XL](https://www.decathlon.de/p/trekking-luftmatratze-trek700-air-xl-gelb/_/R-p-189394)
    I was so satisfied with sleeping on this. Highly reccomended!
- **Sleeping bag:** Decathlon Trek 500 10 °C XL
- **Robens Pump Sack** To inflate my mattress - worked really well.
- **Back panniers:** 2 x Ortlieb Back Roller - The default panier bags to spot German cycle tourists. ;) Have been happy with these for years.
- **Front panniers:** 2 x Vaude Aqua Front - I like the Ortlieb QC lock system better than the Vaude System.
- **Lowrider:** Tubus Tara (the Tubus Duo wouldn't fit.)
- **Rear Carrier:** Racktime Add-It
- **Saddle:** Brooks B17
- **Saddle Post Suspension:** Suntour SP12 NCX
- **Handlebar Front Bag:** [Red Cycling Products Front Loader III schwarz](https://www.amazon.de/Red-Cycling-Products-Lenkertasche-Loader/dp/B07BH2FDPV)
- **Phone Mount:** [Similar to this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Bike-Phone-Holder-Mount-Bracket-Stand-Practical-Aluminium-Alloy-Phone-Mountain-Bike-Mobile-Phone-Holder-Bicycle/32915573992.html) I have tried out many phone mounts for my cycle - but this one has lasted forever and never dropped my phone. Highly recommended.
- repairs:
  - tear aid type A
  - fiber fix spoke repair

# Routing

Routing is not that trivial - the EuroVelo 7 website doesn't publish the official tracks. So we'll orient ourselves along the routes you can get from [bikemap.net](https://www.bikemap.net/en/o/3232816/) and use a combination of OpenStreetmaps (Cycle Layer) and OruxMaps.


# Finding places to sleep

## Sweden

Camping in the wild is allowed in all the nordic countries ("[allmansrätten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam)"). However, if you are really in the woods, it's not so easy to find an even place where you'd pitch up your tent. However, there is a great Facebook group who are putting all the public shelters (Vindskydd) which are free to use on a Google Map: [Vindskydd i Svergie](https://maps.gonehiking.se/) Oftentimes including some images and additional info. So many places had a loo, firefood, and a fireplace. However, due to the extremly hot summer, we were only allowed to light a fire on our last night in a shelter. All other days before, there was stricktly prohibited to light a fire.

We found it great to put up the inner tent net inside the shelters to protect from the mosquitos.

## Denmark

Even though I didn't tour through Danmark yet, I also found a nice list of shelters here: [naturstyrelsen.dk](https://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/overnatning/shelters/)

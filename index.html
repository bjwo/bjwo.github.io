In the summer of 2018 I did a bigger bike trip from Germany through Poland to Finland and back via Sweden, mostly along th EuroVelo 10 around the baltic sea.<br>
Currently, (August '19) I'm cycling with my girlfriend through Sweden (EuroVelo 7) and Denmark back home to Mannheim, Germany. Directly followed by a trip in September along the EuroVelo 6 (or EV13) to Bucharest, Romania to attend the wedding of a good friend.
